## Design

- [x] Let each pokemon type indicator only take 
- [x] When hovering over card, it should slightly move upwards.
- [ ] Figure out how to clean my scss classes.
- [x] Add the pokeball symbol to each card as a background, similar to the figma design
- [x] Add the pokeball symbol to the background also, find a way to set the maximum width of the relative container.
- [x] Finish the colors for Ice, Dragon, and steel.
- [ ] Create a design for the detailed pokemon view. i dont know yet. im very bad at making these 'todos' i dont evn think they help. just makes things overwhelming.

## Functionality

- [x] Find a way to order the uh.. pokemon loading? right now its based on receiving the data or promise.
- [x] then, when pressing a Load More button, render then next 25. and so on so forth. 
- [x] When searching, and pokemon doesn't exist, show a sad pikachu emoji.
- [ ] When clicking on pokemon card, redirect user to its info page.

## Features (Too complex and difficult. will probably take weeks to finish)

- [ ] Uh, do we add a user system? but i dont know how to implement a user. and loging in and signing up in django.
- [ ] With this user system, idk, allow the user to `favorite` a pokemon?
