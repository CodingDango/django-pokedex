## Design
- [ ] Figure out how to clean my scss classes.
- [ ] Create a design for the detailed pokemon view. i dont know yet. im very bad at making these 'todos' i dont evn think they help. just makes things overwhelming.

## Functionality

- [ ] When clicking on pokemon card, redirect user to its info page.

## Features (Too complex and difficult. will probably take weeks to finish)

- [ ] Uh, do we add a user system? but i dont know how to implement a user. and loging in and signing up in django.
- [ ] With this user system, idk, allow the user to `favorite` a pokemon?
